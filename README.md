<h1 align="center">100 Days of SwiftUI</h1>

This repository documents my progress as I work through [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) by Paul Hudson at HackingWithSwift. This learning series consists of daily tasks and projects designed to teach Swift and SwiftUI from scratch.

As an Android engineer with over 12 years experience, I'm eager to expand my skills into new areas, including the iOS ecosystem. Through this learning, I aim to:

- Gain a solid understanding of the Swift programming language.
- Learn the fundamentals of SwiftUI for building user interfaces.
- Create a portfolio of SwiftUI projects showcasing my progress.
